# What’s been updated

- **Homepage redesign** – The hero section now has bold typography, descriptive copy, calls to action, stat cards, and a refined map panel so it matches the Queering the Map inspiration.
- **About page** – Added a full page that explains the project mission, participation guidelines, and links back to the map/repo, all with the same pink palette and fonts.
- **Custom font** – Wired the Fayte Pixel font through `next/font/local` and used it on the key headings (“Abortion Is Normal,” “Ready to add your story?”).
- **Color/typography tweaks** – Baby-pink backgrounds, darker rose headings, and sans-serif body copy for better readability.
- **Map polish** – Introduced a pastel Carto Voyager basemap plus a custom gradient pin SVG so the map visuals align with the rest of the site.
